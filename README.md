# DeepVAD Web Demo

This is the **web-based extension** of the **DeepVAD** project. It includes two main parts: **Datasets & Evaluation Metrics** and **References**. The site provides detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the paper, the evaluation metrics adopted, and the references cited. For each reference, we include its category, link to the original paper, project homepage, and code repository (if available).

This project is currently presented anonymously for review purposes. After the paper is officially published, the project links will be updated to the public version.
